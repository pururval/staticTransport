This is an implementation for tracking the buses at UB based on the time table schedule provided. It was planned to turn out as accurate as a real time tracker, relying on the punctuality of the buses. It was build as a model that didnt rely on external dependencies like installation of tools in buses or mobile phones for real time tracking.
